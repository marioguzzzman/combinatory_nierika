# Combinatory Nierika 

This is from Taper #5: Pent Up, Fall 2020:

Following Taper's: Pent Up invitation to reflect on the significance of the number 5, the term 'Nierika' relates to the quincunx structure, a geometric pattern consisting of four points forming a square and a fifth at its center.
For the Huichols or Wixáritari, an indigenous culture located deep in the mountains of Mexico, it also represents a device crafted by their goddess mother to create the universe: a rhomboid embroidered with her hairs and two crossed arrows provided by her sons.

Nierika also means the "gift-of-seeing", an ability that shamans develop after practicing self-sacrifice, austerity, pilgrimage, fasting, and several other forms of vision searches.
One of the most important of these activities is the ritual travel to Wirikuta, where they recreate the search for the mythical deer that transformed its hearth into a peyote, a cactus with psychoactive properties.
To become a shaman or a healer, an individual must participate in at least five pilgrimages to Wirikuta.

The work "Combinatory Nierika" reimagines, in Spanish and Wixárika, the multiple visions that the Wixáritari may encounter while performing their ritual pilgrimage from the coastlines of Nayarit to Wirikuta, the northern part of San Luis Potosí, where the ritual ends and the sun rises for the first time.

The background color performs a metaphorical passage from the ocean to the desert, and from day to night. By pressing the Wirikuta button, you can experience the minimalistic virtual pilgrimage's time in a 24 hours or 24 seconds scale.

## Taper rules:

* All of your code (in the form of ES6, CSS, and HTML) must must fit within 2KB (2048 bytes) and be placed between the template’s closing header tag (</header>) and the closing body tag (</body>). The whole page must be valid HTML5 when you finish.
* Submissions should not use any external libraries or APIs, nor link to any external resources, including fonts. This is so that pages will be self-contained following Taper’s vision. It also has the practical purpose of allowing all of Taper work without a network connection, for instance on a stand-alone computer in a gallery.
